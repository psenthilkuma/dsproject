Problem Motivation:
Dengue fever outbreak is dependent on various parameters such as temperature, weather, rainfall and the
number of existing dengue cases. By leveraging these dependent parameters as much as possible, we can
try to detect the dengue outbreak. This can be used to provide actionable insights to authorities and prevent
further transmission.
Design Goals, Features Supported:
• Regional Risk Forecasting – As dengue outbreak is dependent on weather, temperature and current
cases, this system will support these parameters for playing out multiple scenarios. This can be
applied to different regions independently, allowing for targeted intervention and resource
allocation.
• Dengue Detection and Spread Prediction Model: A combination of classification (for detecting
cases) and time-series models (for predicting outbreak spread).
• Showcase use of handling Big Data: Utilize big data platforms for efficient data processing,
ensuring scalability and performance in handling large datasets.
